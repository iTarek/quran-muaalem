# Contributing

- Open issues or PRs on https://github.com/obadx/quran-muaalem.
- Keep changes scoped to either `src/quran_muaalem/` or `quran-transcript/` when possible.
- Add or update tests in the relevant test suite (`tests/` or `quran-transcript/tests/`).

If you need a style guide or linting setup, let me know and I can add one.
