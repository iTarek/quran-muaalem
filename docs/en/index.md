features:
  - title: Multi‑level CTC
    details: The model decodes phonemes and Tajweed‑related attributes using a multi‑level CTC head.
  - title: Reference‑aware analysis
    details: Inference compares predicted phonemes with a reference phonetic script from quran-transcript.
  - title: Gradio UI
    details: A ready‑to‑run UI is wired in src/quran_muaalem/gradio_app.py.

## What this repo contains

- Quran Muaalem inference and UI code under `src/quran_muaalem/`.
- A full Quran transcript toolkit under `quran-transcript/` (packaged as `quran-transcript`).
- Deployment and experiment helpers under `deploy/`, `tests/`, and `assets/`.

## For researchers: where to start

If your goal is evaluation or reproducibility:

1. Read **Architecture** to understand multi‑level CTC.
2. Review **Pipeline Steps** for label generation.
3. Use **Evaluation and Metrics** to standardize reporting.
4. Check **Outputs** for the exact output schema.

## Practical notes

- The model expects 16 kHz audio.
- Output quality depends on the reference phonetic script produced by `quran_transcript.quran_phonetizer`.
- Recommended metrics and reporting templates live under **Evaluation and Metrics**.
